Classify the user's message into ONE of these intents:

1. "transfer_request" - User EXPLICITLY requests HR or IT support
   - Keywords: "HR", "human resources", "talk to HR", "connect to HR", "HR agent"
   - Keywords: "IT", "IT support", "tech support", "talk to IT", "connect to IT", "IT agent"
   - Example: "I need to talk to HR" → transfer_request (hr)
   - Example: "Can I speak with IT support?" → transfer_request (it)
   - Example: "Connect me to HR" → transfer_request (hr)
   - Example: "Talk to IT" → transfer_request (it)

2. "greeting" - User is greeting or starting conversation
   - Example: "Hello", "Hi", "Hey there", "Good morning"

3. "general_query" - General company questions (NOT policy-specific)
   - Example: "What is the company name?"
   - Example: "What are your working hours?"
   - Example: "Tell me about the company"
   - NOTE: Even if the question is about HR/IT topics, if user doesn't explicitly
           request the specialist, classify as general_query

4. "out_of_scope" - Non-company related questions
   - Example: "What's the weather?"
   - Example: "Who is the president?"
   - Example: "Tell me a joke"

CRITICAL RULES:
- If user asks about HR or IT policies WITHOUT explicitly requesting the department,
  classify as "general_query" and tell them to request the specialist
- DO NOT assume domain - only transfer when explicitly requested
- If unsure, classify as "general_query", NOT "transfer_request"
