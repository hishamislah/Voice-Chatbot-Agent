   ```

4. **Create .env file** in `backend/` directory with your API keys:
   ```env
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
   ```

5. **Verify documents exist**
   Ensure these PDFs are in `backend/docs/`:
   - Leave Policy.pdf
   - HR_Policy_Art_Technology.pdf

## Testing Guide

### 1. Test Personal Assistant

**Test greeting:**
- User: "Hello"
- Expected: Greeting message with agent options

**Test general query:**
- User: "What is the company name?"
- Expected: Answer from Personal Assistant (no transfer)

**Test explicit transfer to HR:**
- User: "Connect me to HR" or "I need HR"
- Expected: Transfer message, switch to HR Agent tab

**Test explicit transfer to IT:**
- User: "Connect me to IT support" or "Talk to IT"
- Expected: Transfer message, switch to IT Agent tab

**Test no assumption (CRITICAL):**
- User: "What is the leave policy?"
- Expected: Personal Assistant suggests requesting transfer, does NOT auto-transfer

### 2. Test HR Agent

First, ask Personal Assistant: "Connect me to HR"

**Test policy query:**
- User: "What is the sick leave policy?"
- Expected: Answer with citations from Leave Policy.pdf
- Check: Sources displayed with page numbers

**Test clarification:**
- User: "Tell me about leave"
- Expected: Clarification question asking which leave type

**Test out-of-scope (CRITICAL):**
- User: "Who is the Indian president?"
- Expected: Polite decline, stays in HR Agent, suggests Personal Assistant

**Test validation retry:**
- User: "What is the xyz policy?" (intentionally vague)
- Expected: May trigger retry or fallback message

### 3. Test IT Support Agent

First, ask Personal Assistant: "Connect me to IT support"

**Test policy query:**
- User: "What is the password policy?"
- Expected: Answer with citations from IT Security Policy or Compliance Handbook
- Check: Sources displayed with page numbers

**Test clarification:**
- User: "Tell me about security"
- Expected: Clarification question asking for specific topic

**Test out-of-scope (CRITICAL):**
- User: "What's the weather today?"
- Expected: Polite decline, stays in IT Agent, suggests Personal Assistant

### 4. Test Agent Transfers

**Test proper routing:**
1. Start with Personal Assistant
2. Say "Connect me to HR"
3. Verify switch to HR Agent tab
4. Ask HR question
5. Manually switch to Personal Assistant tab
6. Say "Connect me to IT"
7. Verify switch to IT Agent tab

**Test conversation persistence:**
- Send multiple messages to one agent
- Switch tabs manually
- Return to previous agent
- Verify conversation history is preserved

### 5. Test Sources/Citations

**HR Agent:**
- Ask: "How many sick leave days do I get?"
- Verify: Response includes source citations like:
  ```
  Sources:
  [1] Leave Policy.pdf - Page 3
  ```

**IT Agent:**
- Ask: "What is the AI usage policy?"
- Verify: Response includes source citations

## API Documentation

Visit `http://localhost:8000/docs` when server is running for interactive API documentation.

### Key Endpoints

- **POST /api/sessions** - Create new chat session
- **GET /api/sessions/{session_id}** - Get session info
- **POST /api/chat** - Send chat message
- **GET /api/health** - Health check

## Troubleshooting

### Backend Issues

**Error: "RAG initialization failed"**
- Check that all 4 PDF files exist in `backend/docs/`
- Verify file names match exactly

**Error: "GROQ_API_KEY not found"**
- Create `.env` file in `backend/` directory
- Add your Groq API key

**Error: "Module not found"**
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` again
- Verify virtual environment is activated

### Frontend Issues

**Error: "Failed to connect to server"**
- Verify backend is running on port 8000
- Check console for CORS errors
- Try refreshing the page

**Sources not displaying:**
- Verify RAG is retrieving documents (check backend logs)
- Ask specific policy questions (e.g., "sick leave policy")

### Common Issues

**Agent not transferring:**
- Verify you used explicit keywords: "HR", "IT support", "connect to HR"
- Personal Assistant does NOT transfer on policy questions alone

**Out-of-scope questions getting answers:**
- Verify the question is truly out-of-scope
- Check workflow_path in response to see which nodes executed

## Development Tips

### Backend Development

**Enable verbose logging:**
```python
# In api/server.py startup event
rag_system.setup(verbose=True)  # Show RAG initialization details
```

**Test single endpoint:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/sessions
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"session_id":"test","message":"Hello","agent":"personal"}'
```

### Frontend Development

**View API responses in console:**
- Open browser DevTools (F12)
- Check Console tab for API logs
- Check Network tab for request/response details

**Test without backend:**
- Comment out API calls in `handleSend()`
- Use mock responses for UI development
